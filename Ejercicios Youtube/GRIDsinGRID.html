            found it incredibilty fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was te best - and most
            grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a Vr startup. "

            " before joining bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step.
            I was encouraged to enroll by a formed student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The intire curriculum and staff did not disappoint.
            They were very hands-on and I never had ot wait long to assitance. The agile team proyect, in particular, was outstanding, It took my learning to the next level
            in a way that no tutorial could ever have.  In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me
            land a job as a full stack developer after receiving multiple offers. "
